Environment installation
========================

One of the advantages of the Anaconda Suite is that it gives access to a user-friendly GUI for the creation and
maintenance of python environments. Python environments give the user a way to separate different installations of
tools so that different package dependencies do not overlap  with each other. This is especially useful if packages
share the same dependencies but in different versions. The Anaconda Suite provides a quick and intuitive way of
separating these installations.

How to create an environment in Anaconda
------------------------------------------------

When the user opens up the Anaconda software, she/he ends up on the main menu:

The main window shows all the tools available for installation in the Navigator. To get to the environments page, the
user must click on the "Environments" panel that is in the left-side menu.

Once on the Environments page, the user can click on the "create" button that is present at the bottom left of the
screen. A pop up menu will then appear and allow the user to select a python version and a name for the environment.
